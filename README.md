# Apps Script Workspace Add-On Sample

This is a sample project demonstrating a minimal GMail Add-On with Typescript. To set up the
project, run `make init`. This will install all required Node dependencies, and set up Clasp. Run
`make` to build locally, and `make deploy` to install the add-on for testing in GMail.
